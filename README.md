# Password Generator Starter Code

The HTML and CSS was supplied by a third party. The goal of the project was to create the logic for the password generator using Java Script.

## Structure of JS

I psuedo coded a majority of the logic throughout the script via //comments. There are many different approaches to making a randomized generator. For this project, I decided to use a Master Array to collect the information from the user and then generate random characters based on the chosen parameters. If user choses invalid answers:

## Tl;DR
*Take your time understanding the fundamentals of JS before hoping into huge projects. It will save a lot of downtime from researching answers. 

*Manually inputting the elements into the arrays for this project was not pleasant. Make sure to log and reuse huge blocks of code.
